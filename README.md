## Conclusions
- Purpose - We see there are higher count of loans which are taken for debt_consolidation.
- Grade - The Grade and Subgrade represent risk factor thus we can say interest rate increases with the risk. The Grade A which is lowest risk also has lowest DTI ratio which we can say that higher grade has lower rate of default. Same goes for Subgrades as well.
- Public Recorded Bankruptcy - The brrowers are mostly having no record of Public Recorded Bankruptcy and are safe choice for loan issue.
- Term - The majority of loan has a term of 36 months compared to 60 months. The 60 month term has higher chance of defaulting than 36 month term whereas the 36 month term has higher chance of fully paid loan.
- Interest Rate - The default loan amount increases with interest rate
- Invested Amount - Mean value of funded amount invested is little higher for Charged Off loans.
